# Personal-Assistant
This is the code for my personal assistant that I am making to help automate tasks on my computer

This has been coded using VBscript, and is meant to make life easier.

So far it can open various websites that I use quite often through specific key words. It can also answer some basic questions (not many however) and can open various programs (such as notepad and calculator). It provides voice feedback to create the sense of a real person.

Future additions include a larger library of commands and the addition of voice commands to automate functions. I will attempt to use windows macro's to automate these functions. I am also trying to increase the amount of social questions it can answer, create a personality, randomize responses, and increase the fluidity of the voice.
